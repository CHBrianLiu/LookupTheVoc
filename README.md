# Introduction
As a non-native English learner, I love using some app to help me remember the vocabularies. However, most of built-in english dictionary is not suitable for learner. So that I have to import my own word cards with specific definition. I write this app to automatically look up the vocabularies using Merriam-Webster Learners' Dictionary. 

# Requirements 
1. [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
2. [Meriam-Webster API Key](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-learners-dictionary)

# Run the program
**TO BE CONTINUED**

# To-do List
1. Config file
2. Fit for **Quizlet** app
