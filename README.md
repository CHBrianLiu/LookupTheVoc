# Introduction
As a non-native English learner, I love using some app to help me remember the vocabularies. However, most of built-in english dictionary is not suitable for learner. So that I have to import my own word cards with specific definition. I write this app to automatically look up the vocabularies using Merriam-Webster Learners' Dictionary.
